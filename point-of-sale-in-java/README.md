#POS Application for Stores
This straightforward point of sale (pos) software was created in JavaFx for retail and wholesale stores. The modules for sales, purchases, and inventories are finished; the finance module may be developed at a later date. Additionally, I'm searching for an open-source Java contributor who can work with us to build an accounting and finance erp as a whole.
